[cmake] The OpenGL SDK is highly platform dependent and is usually an OS component. It's not realistic to build from source for every platform.
[cmake] 
[cmake]     WINDOWS: is part of the Windows SDK which this package installs.
[cmake]     LINUX: the SDK may be installed from your distro's repo or from 3rd parties manually. There are too many to count.
[cmake]     APPLE: consult your distribution vendor on the state of OpenGL support: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202823
